# TaskOrganizer
Weird floaty VB.NET task list I made for work.

## About
I made this a while back when I needed something to help keep work tasks organized.  

TaskOrganizer contains the actual project code.  TaskTool contains a Windows Installer project (needs the Windows Installer extension installed if you are using VS 2017 or 2019)
